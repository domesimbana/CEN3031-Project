### How To Run
1. Download/Clone Repository
2. Navigate to both the `./backend` and the `./frontend/client` directories.
3. Run the command `npm install` in each directory to install the dependencies.
4. To start the project, use the command `npm start` in both the `./backend` and the `./frontend/client` directories.

### Troubleshooting
